# UnBagger

### Usage
1. Use your tool of choice to extract the embedded object from the Office document.
    ```
    OfficeMalScanner.exe sample.docx inflate
    ```
2. Execute UnBagger, passing the filename of the extracted object as an argument.
    ```
    python unbagger.py oleObject1.bin 
    ```
3. Output includes the secondary payload URLs and the XOR key to decrypt the payloads.

### Changes
#### v1.5 2017-03-21
 - I've removed the 'noise filter' routine due to a tactic shift in recent samples related to the "noise" added to the VB code. Specifically, bogus variable assignments now include nested references, making them much more difficult to detect. For example:
    ```
    PzeIxr=â€œ92"-"22"
    RYPJ9Avt=PzeIxr+EX
    ```
- I expanded the coverage of de-obfuscated strings by creating a table of variable name/value pairs to handle both situations where the de-obfuscation key is passed directly or by reference
    ```
    deob("ObfuscatedString","KeyValue")
    deob("ObfuscatedString",VariableWithKeyValue)
    ```
